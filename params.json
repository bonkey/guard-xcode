Run guard in your Xcode\r\ndirectory, one of two things will happen: all your dreams will come true\r\nOR any time a source file is changed, guard will kick off a build. \r\nGuaranteed or your money back.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\nYou need `bundler`. If you've never used `Bundler` before, you'll need to \r\ninstall the `bundler` gem:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngem install Bundler \r\n```\r\n\r\n(You may need to run this as `sudo`.)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nCreate a Gemfile in your project root:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nsource :rubygems\r\n\r\ngem \"guard-xcode\"\r\ngem \"guard\"\r\ngem \"growl\"\r\ngem \"rb-readline\"   # improved interface for MRI\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `bundle install` and run `guard xcode` in your project root. You may wish\r\nto review the generate Guardfile. At the minimum, you should change the target\r\nto reflect the target you want to build on change (or use `:all => true`).\r\n\r\nIf you want growl support, you'll need to install [GrowlNotify](http://growl.info/downloads#generaldownloads).\r\nSee also the [Growl notes](#growl-notes) in this document.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nThe Xcode Guard supports the following options:\r\n\r\n* `:target` - string defining the target to build (i.e. MyClassTests or MyClass)\r\n* `:configuration` - string defining the build configuration to use\r\n* `:scheme` - string defining the build scheme to use\r\n* `:arch` - string defining the arch to build for\r\n* `:all` - boolean indicated whether to build all targets. If true, overrides :target.\r\n* `:quiet` - only notify on errors / warnings\r\n\r\n<a name=\"growl-notes\">\r\n## Growl Notes\r\n</a>\r\nThere are two options for Growl support:\r\n\r\n* the `growl` gem\r\n* the 'growl_notify' gem\r\n\r\n### `growl`\r\nThis is a safe default, but requires you to download [GrowlNotify](http://growl.info/downloads#generaldownloads).\r\nThis is enabled by default. If you are using the stock version of Ruby shipped\r\nwith OS X, this is what you'll want to use. (Also, if you're using JRuby, \r\nyou'll need to use this.)\r\n\r\n### `growl_notify`\r\nIf you're using a version of Growl from the App Store, i.e. a version >= 1.3, \r\nand you're not using JRuby or MacRuby (the default shipped with OS X), you\r\ncan use this. Instead of `gem \"growl\"` in your `Gemfile`, you'll want to\r\nuse `gem \"growl_notify\"`. Then, in your Guardfile, you'll need to change the\r\n`notification :growl` line to `notification :growl_notify`.","name":"Guard-xcode"}
